# WEIGHTED-HYPERNETWORKS
Various modules created to model weighted hypernetworks for a network science article I wrote.

I apologise for the disorganized layout of this repository. Some of the files ended up not being used for the article, e.g. implementation of Chung-Lu models, however they can be found here anyway.

Many thanks to the creators of 'hypernetx' for their very useful module: https://pnnl.github.io/HyperNetX/ .
